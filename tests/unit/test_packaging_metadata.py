"""Packaging claims must be true of the built artifact.

A classifier is a promise to a consumer's toolchain. ``Typing :: Typed`` tells
mypy and pyright that this distribution ships inline type information, and PEP
561 says they may only use it when a ``py.typed`` marker is present INSIDE the
installed package. Claiming the classifier without shipping the marker means a
downstream user's type checker silently treats every symbol here as ``Any`` —
the failure is invisible, and it is invisible in the direction that loses
safety.

The marker is asserted where it has to live rather than where it happens to be
convenient: adjacent to ``__init__.py``, so the wheel picks it up as package
data.
